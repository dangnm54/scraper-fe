Clear data flow: Props down, events up

min-h-0 / min-w-0 only apply to current component if all of its parent chain allow themselves to shrink (usually defualt is min-0-auto -> expand to show all content)



_____truncate

- truncate only works with
    - want-truncated item -> has truncate, max-w/h-full 
    - parent has overflow-hidden




_____full & max-full

h-full -> Make my height exactly 100% of my parent’s height

max-h-full -> My max height cannot more than 100% of my parent’s height, but I can be smaller if my content is smaller or if another height constraint applies.

Can max-h of child ever exceed the parent if you use h-full?
    - No <- if parent has a fixed or constrained height, h-full never make child exceed parent.
    - Yes <- if parent’s height is not set (or is auto), then h-full on child won’t have any effect, and child can grow as large as its content.

However, if you use only max-h-full (without h-full) -> child will only grow up to the parent’s height, but not necessarily fill it.



____flex-1 & size-full
- flex-1
    - flexible growth in a flex container
    - fill space in main axis (of flex direction)
- size-full 
    - explicitly setting width and height to 100%. (only works if parent has explicit size)
    - try to fill all axis

- when use both -> Fills all space in both axes
